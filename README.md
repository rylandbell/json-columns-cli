## Usage

### On the Web

The simplest way to use this tool is to copy some JSON to your clipboard and visit [json-columns.com](http://json-columns.com).

### From the Command Line

The command-line tool generates a local JSON Columns page pre-loaded with data.

Install:

`npm install -g json-columns`

To use, pass the app the path of a JSON-encoded file:

`json-columns data.json`

Alternatively, pipe it JSON data directly via standard input. For example:

`curl -# https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts | json-columns`
