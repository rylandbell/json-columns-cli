# JSON Columns CLI

Navigate JSON-encoded data in a simple column-based interface, either to gain a general sense of the data structure or to create a copy-pastable path to a given value. 

## Usage

###Web version:

The simplest way to use this tool is to copy some JSON to your clipboard and visit [json-navigator.com](http://json-navigator.com).

###Command line:

Install:

`npm install -g json-columns`

To use, pass the app a JSON-encoded file.

`json-columns my-file.json`

This will generate a JSON Columns page pre-loaded with data from the supplied JSON file.
